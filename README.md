# 8008-SBC
Home-brew Intel 8008 single board computer with SCELBAL BASIC interpreter in EPROM. The hardware design borrows heavily from Len Bayles's 
[Intel 8008 Computer Clock](http://www.8008chron.com/) and Jim Kearney's [Tiny 8](https://www.jkearney.com/Tiny8demo/). The SCELBAL BASIC Interpreter can be found at Mike Willegal's [SCELBAL BASIC page](http://www.willegal.net/scelbi/scelbal.html).
