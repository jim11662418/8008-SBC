Visit Mike Willegal's [8008/SCELBI Applications](http://www.willegal.net/scelbi/apps8008.html) page for more information about the applications in this folder. 
Assemble the applications in this folder using the [Macro Assembler AS](http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/) and use the assembler's 'p2hex' utility to produce Intel HEX object files. On the SBC, remove the jumper connected to the EPROM's A13 input to access the monitor. Use the monitor's HEX file download function to load the application's object code. The application should start automatically when the code finishes loading.

I've also uploaded versions of the files that use the 'new' Intel 8008 mneumonics. I happen to prefer the new mneumonics. Your choice. Both versions of a particular application produce the same object code.
